## Changes for 3.5.0
*   **Command Layer:** Introduced a Command Layer system (default: `NVDA+Shift+V`) to group shortcuts under a single master key. For example, instead of pressing `NVDA+Control+Shift+T` for translation, you now press `NVDA+Shift+V` followed by `T`.
*   **Online Video Analysis:** Added a new feature to analyze YouTube and Instagram videos directly by providing a URL.
    *   *Note on Instagram:* This feature relies on a third-party service. While verified to be working at the time of this release, it may be subject to future instability.
