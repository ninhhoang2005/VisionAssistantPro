Vision Assistant Pro Documentation

# Vision Assistant Pro

**Vision Assistant Pro** is an advanced, multi-modal AI assistant for NVDA. It leverages Google's Gemini models to provide intelligent screen reading, translation, voice dictation, and document analysis capabilities.

_This add-on was released to the community in honor of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities._

## 1. Setup & Configuration

Go to **NVDA Menu > Preferences > Settings > Vision Assistant Pro**.

- **API Key:** Required. The field is masked by default for security (use "Show API Key" to view). Get a free key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
- **Model:** Choose between **Flash** (Fastest/Free) or **Pro** (High Intelligence) models based on your needs.
- **Languages:** Set Source, Target, and AI Response languages.
- **Smart Swap:** Automatically swaps languages if the source text matches the target language.
- **Direct Output:** Skips the chat window and announces the response directly via speech.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Automatically copies the AI response to the clipboard.

\## Changes for 3.5.0
\*   \*\*Command Layer:\*\* Introduced a Command Layer system (default: `NVDA+Shift+V`) to group shortcuts under a single master key. For example, instead of pressing `NVDA+Control+Shift+T` for translation, you now press `NVDA+Shift+V` followed by `T`.
\*   \*\*Online Video Analysis:\*\* Added a new feature to analyze YouTube and Instagram videos directly by providing a URL.

## Changes for 3.0
